# JoeHaines.co.uk

This is the code that powers my personal website [joehaines.co.uk](https://www.joehaines.co.uk).

## Developing

- `yarn start` to launch local express server on port 3000
- `yarn build` to build blog locally
- `yarn watch` to watch files in `src/` for changes and rebuild

## Writing

New blog posts are markdown files in the `posts` directory and have filenames of the post creation date in `YYYY-MM-DD` format.

Each post has a `title` and `description` in front matter, e.g.

```markdown
---
title: Hello world
description: Let's see if this works...
---
```

The body of the post then follows.
