# JoeHaines.co.uk

This is the code that powers my personal website [joehaines.co.uk](https://www.joehaines.co.uk).

It's built with [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/), a static site generator written in Rust.

Follow the [Zola installation instructions](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/getting-started/installation/) and [CLI usage](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/getting-started/cli-usage/) to build the site yourself.
