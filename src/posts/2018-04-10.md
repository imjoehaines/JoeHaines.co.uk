[Autodux](https://github.com/ericelliott/autodux) is a library, written by [Eric Elliott](https://ericelliottjs.com/), to help automate Redux boilerplate.

Autodux lets you create everything you need for a Redux app in a handful of lines of code:

```js
const {
  reducer,
  actions,
  selectors
} = autodux({
  initial: {
    username: 'Anonymous',
    email: 'anonymous@example.com'
  }
})
```

In this single call to autodux, you get a Redux reducer and an action 
and selector for each key in the `initial` state object.

## Reducer

An autodux reducer is just a standard Redux reducer that's automatically setup to handle autodux actions. It's used like any other Redux reducer:

```js
const { reducer } = autodux({ … })

const store = createStore(reducer)
```

## Actions

A call to autodux returns an `actions` object which contains a function for each key in the `initial` state. For example, using the `initial` state from the above example, we would get setters for `username` and `email` inside the `actions` object:

```js
{
  setUsername: Function,
  setEmail: Function
}
```

When one of these is called, it behaves like any standard Redux action creator, e.g.

```js
actions.setUsername('abcd')

→ {
→   type: '/setUsername',
→   payload: 'abcd'
→ }
```

## Selectors

A call to autodux also returns a `selectors` object which, like `actions`, contains a function for each key in the `initial` state. These functions are selectors, which means they are functions for retrieving specific parts of the state tree. For example, using the `initial` state from the above example, we would get selectors for `username` and `email`:

```js
selectors.getUsername(state)

→ 'abcd'
```
