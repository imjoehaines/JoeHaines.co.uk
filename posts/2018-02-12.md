Hi!

This is a totally static blog system built with React. It renders Markdown blog posts into React components and (using [x0](https://github.com/c8r/x0)) builds a static site from the resulting HTML.

It uses [Prism.js](http://prismjs.com/) for syntax highlighting&hellip;

```js
const people = ['Amelia', 'Andrew']

people.map(person => `Hello ${person}!`)
```

&hellip;and [styled-components](https://www.styled-components.com/) makes it look pretty.

I'm using [Netlify](https://netlify.com/) for hosting and instant deployment (including of PRs and branches). I'll shortly have a write up of how it all ties together.
